      <h3> Once upon a time.</h3>   
      <p> Hello web wanderer, welcome to my personal internet hub.  So, where should I begin? I guess the beginning usually works. </p>
      <p>I grew up in Los Angeles, California, daughter of an entrepreneur and educator.  After going to school to study foreign languages, I took a brief dip into the fashion world to satisfy my urge to learn how to make clothing professionally.  Then, for a change of scene, I headed east on what turned out to be a permanent detour to my father's hometown of Chicago. </p>

      <p>Fast forward nearly eight years later and I’ve worked mostly in education building up a diverse skill set in, administration, project coordination and presentation design. I currently work as Project Manager and Associate Designer at Next Door Multimedia, a website and app development company. </p>

      <p>I've always been interested in communicating with people or facilitating the communication  between people, evidenced by my penchant for learning languages. For years I've searched for ways to combine my love of design and communicating and didn’t realize that my digital doodling could become a career.  Now, that’s what I do.  

  <!--      <p>After having moved to Chicago, I realize that I thoroughly enjoy "commenting" about the weather. And since there is something to actually "comment" about compared to living in sunny southern California, I just call it catching up. You might find that out if you followed my tweets.
</p>

    <p>Deciding to pursue this degree seemed like a natural progression in my ever-present desire to facilitate information transfer and communication in a beautiful way. </p>

   <p>Educational background. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Foreign Languages, a Certificate in Fashion Design, and a pending Master's Degree in Technical Communication and Information Design. </p> -->
