      <h3 class="lead"> Once upon a time.</h3>   
      <p> Born and raised in Los Angeles California, daughter of entrepreneur and educator. After graduating from Scripps College with a Bachelor of Arts in Foreign Languages (Spanish and French), I took a brief dip in the fashion world to satisfy my urge to learn how to make clothing professionally (which incidentally triggered learning about Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and color theory), then headed east on what turned out to be a permanent detour to my father's hometown of Chicago.</p>

      <p>Almost immediately after arriving in Chicago I landed a job as administrative coordinator at Stuart School of Business at Illinois Institute of Technology. And there I stayed for a quite a while, accumulating skills in many areas, acquiring a diverse skillset as my duties that began in general administration, and grew to include event coordination, design, student assistant management, and project management. I recently left IIT to continue advancing my skill-set as Project Manager and Associate Designer at Next Door Multimedia. Here, I focus on making it happen on website and app development projects.</p>

      <p>I took advantage of the educational opportunities available working at a university and am currently finishing up my Master's in Technical Communication and Information Design. Deciding to pursue this degree seemed like a natural progression in my ever-present desire to facilitate information transfer and communication in a beautiful way. </p>
