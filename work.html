      <h2>Work process</h2>
   <p>
Whole process in 3 deceptively simple steps
Make it Real
We always start by taking into account the meaningful everyday user experiences. ‘Real’ is not the same for everyone or for every project, so defining what it is is an ever-changing and often challenging process that involves first asking the right questions.
Make it Pretty 
It’s not a coincidence that functional design is usually very pleasing to the eye. Highly effective design makes the information it is transforming accessible and inviting as the content should be.
Make it Happen
We bring it all together to make it happen, however possible because, well, otherwise, what’s the point?
Repeat
Life is not stagnant and neither is the information or design trends that inform our everyday lives. The real changes as much as it needs to and, because it is tied to the real, so too can design. Regular evaluations must be made to make sure that projects are real and pretty in the now.
</p>
   <p> collaboration. I love working with people and nothing beats the --- that comes with helping others and exchanging knowledge with others members of the team.
